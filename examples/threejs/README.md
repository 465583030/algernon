Note
----

* Loding the font and javascript files is what takes time. The conversion from Amber and GCSS is negligible.

* Accessing this directory as `/examples/gcss/` instead of `/examples/gcss` is possible, but then `style.gcss` is not found, since it will be searched for in the examples directory instead of in the gcss directory.
