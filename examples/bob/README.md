Instructions
------------

This is the same example as the one that is used at [permissions2](https://github.com/xyproto/permissions2), ported to Algernon.

If no server.lua file is provided, the default permissions for the permissions2 package are used (/data and /repo have user permissions, /admin has admin permissions and the rest is public).

Either customize the permissions in server.lua, or run algernon from this directory.
