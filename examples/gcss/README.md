Note
----

* Loading the Playball font takes more time than everything else put together. The conversion from Amber and GCSS to HTML and CSS is not cached, but is reasonably quick (8ms for the Amber page and 4ms for the GCSS page, on my computer, in Chrome).

* Accessing this directory as `/examples/gcss/` instead of `/examples/gcss` is possible, but then `style.gcss` is not found, since it will be searched for in the examples directory instead of in the gcss directory.
