Self-contained sample applications for Algernon
===============================================

Give an .alg file as the first argument to algernon to run it.

* `first.alg` just displays a simple message
* `64-bit_linux/withplugins.alg` runs a Go plugin that is compiled for 64-bit Linux

(`.alg` files are `.zip` files, just like `.war` files for Java)
